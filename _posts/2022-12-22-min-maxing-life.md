## What is Min-Maxing?
A few days ago, my friend, [Arvindh](https://arvindh-manian.github.io/ "Arvindh's Blog") and I were discussing the ideal ratio of social skills and intellect that a person should possess. Although our conversation was relatively short-lasted, it provoked quite a few thoughts. Would it be better to be more social or intelligent? Would a 50/50 split be optimal? It's interesting to think about.

There's this idea in video games that strongly correlates to this:

Min-maxing (noun)
: The character-building strategy of maximizing a specific desirable ability, skill, or other power of a character while sacrificing less desirable traits

In many games, you're given a finite number of "skill points" that you're allowed to assign towards a variety of statistics (stats, for short)--strength, defense, charisma, and intelligence, to name a few. If you want your character to be a fighter, it would make sense to allocate the majority of your points to strength and defense. However, a wizard may find the intelligence stat preferable. The assignment of these points is referred to as:

Specing (verb)
: The expenditure of resources, to gain abilities or advantages

The concept of min-maxing is something that frequently applies to real-life.

Consider the activities that you partake in each day. Maybe you like playing an instrument, so you set aside an hour each day to practice. Maybe you are trying to eat healthier, so you choose to cook your own meals instead of eating out. Maybe you go to the gym because you enjoy the physical and mental health benefits. The hundreds of actions that we take are conscious decisions of how we choose to spend our time. You can think of the time we spend on these actions as investments towards specific stats. For instance, practicing an instrument could improve your intelligence or charisma stats.

**_In real life, spending time on an activity is analagous to specing into a stat_**

## Min-Maxing in Real Life vs. in Video Games

There are a few key differences between min-maxing in real life and min-maxing in video games:

1. **There are way more than the several stats that exist in games**
: The infinite number of activities that we can pursue in real life means that there are infinitely many unique stats that we can spec into. Plus, there are nuances to each of the stats. Intelligence could be broken down into many different subdivisions: logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, musical intelligence, etc. There are even stats that blur the lines between simple, more fundamental stats (e.g. social intelligence). Qualifying what you are specing into in real life is not as simple as it is in a game.
2. **Some people may be naturally better/more inclined to develop a specific stat than others**
: The environment that you are born into heavily dictates what stats you value. For instance, if you're born into an economically disadvantaged family, you may be more inclined to spec into intelligence because pursuing higher-level education generally correlates to higher income. However, if you're born into a wealthy family, you may be able to allocate more time into specing into charisma because connections and influence over others is a versatile skill that can be applied to many different situations.
3. **Progress towards the development of a stat is not guaranteed**
: When you start an activity in a game, tools like experience bars make it apparent as to how much progress you've made towards a set goal. In real life, however, you could spend countless hours working on an issue that never gets resolved or sink years into a fruitless career that never takes off. Factors outside of your control often make it difficult to determine the payoff of an action. You just have to have trust in your actions and hope that whatever you believe to be most worth your time is actually what you expect.
4. **Decision calculations are skewed by hedonistic desires**
: Games are crafted to ensure that developing skills is fun. However, this is often false in real life. Usually, the most desirable traits are the ones that are the most difficult to develop (due to supply and demand). Subsequently, we may be more inclined to spec into the less desirable, easier-to-develop-stats. For instance, even if you know that you'll be happier in the long run if you spend time studying for an exam (investing in intelligence), you may not be able to resist the urge to go out with friends (investing in social). Because most of us live our lives greedily, optimizing for total happiness over the forseeable future, the time investments (specing choices) we make are often based on our current desires and expectations, which may not always be in our best interest.

With the limitations[^fn1]: of min-maxing in real life in mind, we can move on to talk about the interesting implications of it in real life.  


## Relevance of Stats In Real Life

But generally, we don't think of the actions we take every day as trading time for stats (at least I don't). 

What's interesting is that the stats that you choose to spec into aren't exactly what other people see. It's more important what other people see, though. For instance, if you want to be a successful entrepreneur, you may need to spec into charisma and intelligence. However, if you want to be a successful politician, you may need to spec into charisma and social skills.

Since coming to college, I've been paying close attention to the composition of successful social groups and I've noticed that there exists a strong correlation betwwen what "stats" people spec into and the social groups that they belong to. Archetypes like the "CS nerd" or the "jock" are not just stereotypes--they are a collection of people who have chosen to spec into certain stats. Their shared stat preferences are likely indicators of shared interests and values.

What you decide to spec into dictates your social niche. In every social group, 

So, what can we do about that? This past year, I've been getting into self-help books. One of the most insightful pieces of advice that I've come upon is that it's important to identify your core values so that you can more easily evaluate whether an action will work towards your overall "life" goal. This essentially boils down to knowing what stats you want to spec into, so that you can plan your time accordingly.

There is a non-linear reward to specing into certain stats. When you first start investing time into a stat, you may not see immediate results. Your value and career capital increases exponentially as you continue to invest in a stat.

Plus, once you become proficient at a certain stat, you can leverage that skill to spec into other stats. For instance, if you're a good public speaker, you can use that skill to spec into charisma. If you're a good writer, you can use that skill to spec into intelligence. If you're a good athlete, you can use that skill to spec into social skills.

[^fn1]: Okay, I'll admit that there's a lot of issues with getting specific about how min-maxing translates into real-life. How can one even quantify stats? What does 20 points into intelligence mean as opposed to 50? Real-life poses a mess of abstractions so bringing this idea to levels of granularity gets super confusing.
