A few days ago, my friend, [Arvindh](https://arvindh-manian.github.io/ "Arvindh's Blog") and I were talking about the optimal ratio of social skills and intellect that a person should possess. Although our conversation was relatively short-lasted, it provoked quite a few thoughts. Would it be better to be more social or intelligent? Would a 50/50 split be optimal? It's interesting to think about.

There's this idea in video games that strongly correlates to this:

Min-maxing (noun)
: The character-building strategy of maximizing a specific desirable ability, skill, or other power of a character while sacrificing less desirable traits

In many games, you're given a finite number of "skill points" that you're allowed to assign towards a variety of statistics (stats, for short)--strength, defense, charisma, and intelligence, to name a few. If you want your character to be a fighter, it would make sense to allocate the majority of your points to strength and defense. However, a wizard may find the intelligence stat more preferable. The assignment of these points is referred to as:

Specing (verb)
: The expenditure of resources, to gain abilities or advantages

The concept of min-maxing is something that frequently applies to real-life.

Consider the activities that you partake in each day. Maybe you like playing an instrument, so you set aside an hour each day to practice. Maybe you are trying to eat healthier, so you choose to cook your own meals instead of eating out. Maybe you go to the gym because you enjoy the physical and mental health benefits. The hundreds of actions that we take are conscious decisions of how we choose to spend our time. The way we choose to allocate our time dictates which stats to develop. For instance, playing an instrument could improve your "intelligence" or "charisma" stats.

**_Spending time on an activity is analagous to specing into a stat._**

One of the main differences between a video game and real-life is that in real-life, there isn't a preset assortment of stats that the myriad of possible actions map to. Plus, there are nuances to each of the stats. Intelligence could be broken down into a ton of subdivisions: logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, musical intelligence, etc. There are even stats that blur the lines between traditional, more simple stats (e.g. social intelligence). The number of stats in real-life is practically infinite.

But generally, we don't think of the actions we take every day as trading time for stats (at least I don't). Most of us live our lives greedily, optimizing for total happiness over the forseeable future. The problem is, humans really suck at predicting the future. Our subconscious gravitates towards fulfilling our hedonistic desires, which really messes with our decision calculations. 

Also, it's not always apparant as to what the reward is when you start an activity. You could spend countless hours working on an issue that never gets resolved or sink years into a fruitless career that never takes off. Life doesn't have an experience bar that tells you exactly when you'll improve at a stat. 

So, what can we do about that? This past year, I've been getting into self-help books. One of the most insightful pieces of advice that I've come upon is that it's important to identify your core values so that you can more easily evaluate whether an action will work towards your overall "life" goal. This essentially boils down to knowing what stats you want to spec into, so that you can plan your time accordingly.


## Problems

Okay, I'll admit that there's a lot of issues with this whole "min-maxing" idea translating to real-life. How can one even quantify stats? What does 20 points into intelligence mean as opposed to 50? Real-life poses a mess of abstractions so bringing this idea to levels of granularity makes lose its meaning.


## Points to talk about
- [X] people may optimize for what they enjoy rather than what would bring them (conventional) career success
- [X] It's not always apparant as to what the payoff is when you start an activity (games have exp pts)
- [X] There are way more than the `n` stats that exist in games in real life: each stat has sub stats as well (different types of intelligence)
- [ ] there are things that people may be talented at already, should you spec that rather than the stats that make you happy?
- [ ] the stats that you choose to spec into aren't exactly what other people see. it's more important what other people see, though
- [ ] why should we care about these stats? there's a lot to be said about the correlation between what "stats" people choose to spend their time developing and the dynamics that exist in social circles (e.g. social groups can form due to common interests, and these common interests may have an archetype associated with them-- i've noticed that some of my friends in CS also happen to be interested in the same YouTube channels that I'm interested in: e.g. Tom Scott).
