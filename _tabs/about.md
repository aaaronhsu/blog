## Hello! My name is Aaron Hsu and I'm an eighteen-year-old from NYC.

I have ideas. Sometimes I share them with my friends but more often than not, they linger in my mind until they dissipate into thin air. This website aims to solve that.

This website is meant to be a cross between a blog and a portfolio, a place where I can share my random thoughts and showcase my projects. It also serves as somewhat of a time capsule for my college years. I hope you find some of it interesting!


### Here are some quick facts about me:
- Freshman @ Duke University studying Electrical/Computer Engineering and Computer Science
- Hobbies include rock climbing, performing with fire, and building keyboards


Throughout high school, I dabbled in a few fields in CS including competitive coding, full-stack web development, AI, and Quantum, but I'm not yet sure what I want to do as a career. However, I do know that I love working on small engineering projects and so, for now, I'm working on building prototypes of useful devices that I wish existed. Who knows, maybe one of those prototypes will turn into an entrepreneurial adventure.
