## Hello! My name is Aaron Hsu and I'm an eighteen-year-old from NYC.

I have ideas. Sometimes I share them with my friends but more often than not, they linger in my mind until they dissipate into nothingness. The solution: this website! 

This website is meant to be a mix between a blog and a portfolio, a place where I can share my random thoughts and showcase my projects. It also serves as somewhat of a time capsule for my college years. 

### Here are some quick facts about me:
- Freshman @ Duke University studying Electrical/Computer Engineering and Computer Science
- Interested in entrepreneurship
- 


I am currently a freshman at Duke University studying Electrical/Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I'm thinking about going into entrepreneurship, but I'm not quite sure yet. 

In my free time, I like to rock climb, perform with fire, and work on small engineering projects. Sometimes I also build keyboards.
